This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that contains all of our Python code. Among the infinite ways to keep the time in a programming language like Python, we decided to define daily updates of a population instantiated through the initialize_population() function. The population information is self-contained in a Python dictionary which keeps track of each individual status through time-varying and time-invariant variables. Vaccine rollouts are updated first through the vaccine_update()function and then infections are updated through the update_population() function. All the parameters can be conveniently set at the beginning of the script along with any policy combinations (including and not limited to severity of containment policies) and probability of infection (including and not limited to vaccine efficacy) might be passed. simulate_pandemic() is the main function running the simulation with the chosen parameters. Functions have been thoroughly commented with parameter definitions and code explanations. Again, our main goal was to provide a flexible framework which is able to accommodate the vagaries of disease outbreaks and policy responses keeping the modeling assumptions (e.g., vaccines happening at the beginning of the day) to a minimum.
